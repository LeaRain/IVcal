IV cal is a small IV calculator for pokemon, written in Python.   
It uses [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and the python wrapper [Pokepy](https://pokeapi.github.io/pokepy/).

The application is used on the command line and simple user input. The necessary pokemon data can be stored locally in a SQLite database file or can be fetched with the PokéAPI.
